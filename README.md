# Rails 8 + React Template

This is a template for a Rails 8 application with React integration. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.0.0 or higher
- Rails 8.0.0 or higher
- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- Yarn
- Foreman

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    bundle install
    yarn install
    ```

3. Set up the database:

    ```sh
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    ```

4. Start the application using Foreman:
